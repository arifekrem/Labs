            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                The pure CSS version (Part A) gives designers more control over every pixel on the page. Everything can be custom-styled without any constraints. On the other hand, the Bootstrap version (Part B) provides a standardized, modern look right out of the box, ensuring consistency and faster design development.

        <section>
            <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
            <p>
                While both versions can be made responsive, the Bootstrap version achieves this more efficiently. Bootstrap's grid system and built-in classes allow for quick and intuitive responsive design. In contrast, the pure CSS version requires manual media queries and more effort to achieve similar responsiveness.

            <h2>Ease of Use</h2>
            <p>
                For beginners or those looking to quickly prototype a design, Bootstrap can be easier to use due to its pre-defined components. Pure CSS requires a more in-depth understanding of CSS properties and values but offers greater flexibility in the long run.

        <section>
            <h2>Load Times and Performance</h2>
            <p>
                The pure CSS approach might be lighter since it only includes the styles that are explicitly written. Bootstrap, being a comprehensive framework, includes a lot of additional styles and scripts, which could slightly affect the load times, especially if only a fraction of its capabilities are being used.

        <section>
            <h2>Customization and Flexibility</h2>
            <p>
                Pure CSS offers the utmost flexibility as designers can define every aspect of the design. Bootstrap is customizable but within the constraints of its predefined components and classes. However, Bootstrap's SASS variables can be tweaked to create a unique look.
